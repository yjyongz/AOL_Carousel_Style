NOTES:
1.I DID NOT USE ANY 3rd-party's plug-ins (JQuery,Dojo etc.)
2.twitter api seems have same-origin problem, so i turned tweets into .txt file
3. DO NOT Double click MYAOL.html in your laptop

how to test:
1. put the link "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=YOUR_TWITTER_ID"
into your browser, and put the results into tweets.txt
2. visit MYAOL.html by HTTP protocol , like http://localhost/MYAOL.html
3.if you could not make local visit, visit www.mashengjun.info/MYAOL.html instead

step:
I.
1) first you need to enter your twitter ID
2) and then click fetch.

II.
1) first you need to enter your twitter ID
2) input miles you want to fetch
3) and then click fetch.
